# Lesson Plan: Creating a Countdown Timer GUI in Python

## Objective
- Students will learn to create a GUI-based Countdown Timer application using Python and Tkinter.
- Students will gain hands-on experience with event-driven programming, threading, and multimedia integration.

## Prerequisites
- Basic understanding of Python programming concepts.
- Familiarity with Tkinter library.

## Materials
- Python installed on students' machines.
- Integrated Development Environment (IDE) with Tkinter support (e.g., VSCode, PyCharm).
- A sound file for the alert (e.g., "alert_sound.mp3").

## Lesson Structure

### 1. Introduction (10 minutes)
- Briefly explain the purpose of the lesson: to create a GUI-based Countdown Timer.
- Discuss the importance of GUI applications and countdown timers in various scenarios.

### 2. Overview of Tools and Libraries (15 minutes)
- Introduce Python and Tkinter for GUI development.
- Explain the use of the Pygame library for multimedia integration.
- Discuss the relevance of threading for updating the timer without freezing the GUI.

### 3. Setting Up the Project (20 minutes)
- Guide students through creating a new Python project.
- Set up a virtual environment for the project.
- Install necessary libraries: Tkinter and Pygame.

### 4. Writing the `play_alert_sound()` Function (15 minutes)
- Explain the purpose of the function and how it integrates with Pygame for audio.
- Assist students in writing the function to play an alert sound.

### 5. Designing the Countdown Timer Class (30 minutes)
- Introduce the concept of classes and objects.
- Guide students in designing the `CountdownTimer` class:
  - Initialize the timer variables.
  - Create a Tkinter window and label.
  - Implement the timer update loop.

### 6. Implementing the GUI (30 minutes)
- Instruct students on creating the main script execution block.
- Assist in writing the `run_gui()` function.
- Test the GUI by running the script with a sample duration.

### 7. Extra Practice - Video Tutorial (Optional)
- Provide students with a link to a video tutorial on creating a Tkinter Countdown Timer: [Tkinter GUI Tutorial - Creating a Countdown Timer](example_video_link)

### 8. Additional Features (30 minutes)
- Challenge students to add extra features:
  - Pause and resume functionality.
  - Allow users to set the timer duration dynamically.

### 9. Q&A and Troubleshooting (20 minutes)
- Address any questions or issues students may encounter.
- Discuss potential improvements and modifications.

### 10. Homework Assignment (15 minutes)
- Assign a homework task: Modify the countdown timer to display minutes and seconds separately.

## Assessment
Students will be assessed based on:
- Successful implementation of the countdown timer GUI.
- Ability to integrate the `play_alert_sound()` function.
- Creativity in adding extra features to the timer.
- Participation in Q&A and completion of the homework assignment.
