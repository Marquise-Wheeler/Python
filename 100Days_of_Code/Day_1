# Day-1 Ex.4 -- Working with variables
# take the following inputs and reverse them 
a = input("a: ")

####################
#The code to reverse the variables is here
c = a  # assign a new variable to hold the value of a
a = b
b = c

# the code to reverse the order the variables are printed is as follows
print("a: " + a)
print("b: " + b)
